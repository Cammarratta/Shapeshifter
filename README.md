# Shapeshifter
Shapeshifter is a revolutionary clipboard manager that you might know of already. It can be downloaded [here](http://flamefusion.net/software/shapeshifter),
although that link is for Version 4. 

Version 5 is the first version to go Open Source, on this repository. It is a complete rewrite, so expect it to take some time to get it ready.

## Life is tough - help us manage
We represent a small group of friends working on Shapeshifter in our spare time (which we don't have a lot of). If you like our effort, feel free to tip us a bit.
Every dollar matters!
